Step\nGeneration of a random position for a single dart within a square. The square extends from -1 to +1 in the X-direction, as well as in the Y-direction.\nUse a random number generator for a uniform distribution and save the result in the two variables x and y (GAP are placeholder)\n\nx &lt;- runif(n = GAP, min = GAP, max = GAP)\ny &lt;- GAP\n\n\n\n2. Step\nNow calculate the distance from this position to the center. You can use the following simplified formula for our chosen square\n\ndist &lt;- x**2 + y**2\nprint(dist)\n\n[1] 1.041785\n\n\n\n\n3. Step\nCreate a decision rule and print “inside” if the point is inside the circle or “outside” if it is not.\n\nif (dist &lt;= GAP) {\n  GAP\n} else {\n  GAP\n}\n\n\n\n4. Step\nCreate now a loop (use for or while statement) and execute the code from steps 1 to 3 within it. You should get something like that now\nHint: Use may 10 iteration for the beginning\n\n\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"outside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n\n\n\n\n5. Step\nCopy now the code from Step 4 and modify it in a way that instead of outputting a result for each point, it sums up the number of “insides”.\nUse something like that,\n\nn_insides &lt;- 0\nn_insides &lt;- n_insides + 1\nprint(n_insides)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nor more elegant write the results in a vector.\n\nv_insides &lt;- rep(x = 0, 10)\nv_insides[2] &lt;- 1\nprint(v_insides)\n\n [1] 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nIf you use 1000 iteration you should became such a number\n\n\n[1] 782"
